    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Chicken biryani is a tantalizing blend of tender chicken pieces and
      fragrant basmati rice, infused with a symphony of spices and herbs.
      Marinated in a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and an array of
      spices, the chicken becomes infused with layers of flavor, promising
      succulence with every bite. Basmati rice, parboiled and seasoned with
      whole spices like cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon, provides the perfect
      canvas for this culinary masterpiece. Each grain of rice is infused with
      the essence of the spices, offering a delicate yet aromatic backdrop to
      the star of the dish—the chicken. The layering process is crucial, as the
      marinated chicken is carefully nestled between layers of seasoned rice in
      a heavy-bottomed pot or biryani handi. Fragrant fried onions, fresh mint
      leaves, and chopped cilantro are sprinkled throughout, adding bursts of
      freshness and color. Once assembled, the pot is sealed tightly to trap the
      steam, allowing the flavors to meld and the chicken to cook to tender
      perfection. The result is a tantalizing harmony of flavors and textures,
      with each spoonful offering a symphony of tastes that dance on the palate.
      Finally, the biryani is gently fluffed with a fork, revealing layers of
      aromatic rice and succulent chicken, ready to be savored and enjoyed with
      accompaniments like raita or a crisp salad. Chicken biryani is more than
      just a dish—it's an experience that enchants the senses and brings people
      together in celebration of good food and cherished traditions.

        Marinate the chicken by mixing it with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste,

        minutes to an hour or overnight.

        Prepare the rice by rinsing basmati rice, soaking it for 30 minutes,

        done, then draining and setting aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the saffron by warming milk and adding saffron. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the chicken by heating ghee/oil, cooking onions until golden,

        and cooking until partially done with thickened gravy.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate pot, layer partially cooked rice over chicken, drizzle
        saffron milk over rice, and optionally add fried onions, potatoes,
        cashews, and raisins. Cover tightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dum cook on low heat for 20-30 minutes to meld flavors and cook chicken
        completely.

        Serve by fluffing biryani with a fork, garnishing with cilantro, fried
        onions, and lemon wedges, and serving hot.
